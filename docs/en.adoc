Stefan Marinov (1931–1997), a Bulgarian born experimental and
theoretical physicist who invented a new and highly original method to
measure the anisotropy of the observable velocity of light (the “coupled
shutters” experiment). He reported on the results of his experiment in a
few short papers published in the peer-reviewed journals (_Physics Letters,
General Relativity and Gravitation, Foundations of Physics_, etc.). After
his formal education, Stefan Marinov worked from 1960 to 1974 with the
research staff and also as an Assistant Professor, at the Faculty of Physics,
Sofia University. Whilst there he devised and set up his first “coupled shutters” experiment and with it detected an anisotropy in the observed velocity
of light. His life in Bulgaria was difficult: he was jailed in 1966/1967,
1974, and 1977, by the Bulgarian communist regime, for inappropriate
“political thinking”. In 1977 Marinov was deported from Bulgaria as a
“political dissident”. After a few years in Belgium, the USA, and Italy, he
continued his research in Graz, Austria, which became his home until his
tragic death in 1997. Despite the significant attention drawn to his experiment in the 1980’s (many papers discussing his experiment were published in Nature and other journals), no other scientists attempted to repeat
it. On the other hand, the experiment is simple, cheap, and can be easily
repeated in any well-equipped physics laboratory. We therefore publish this
detailed description of the experiment, as given by Marinov himself in
_Deutsche Physik_, in 1992. The editors hope that this posthumous publication
encourages and assists scientists who would like to repeat and enhance the
“coupled shutters” experiment. (This paper was submitted by courtesy of
Erwin Schneeberger, who was a close friend of Dr. Marinov, at Graz.)

== 1. Introduction

I carried out the “coupled shutters” experiment for the first
time in 1979 in Brussels{fn-1}{fn-2}.
The precision achieved with that first experiment was not sufficient for accurately
determining the Earth’s absolute velocity. Thus with that
experiment I could only establish that this velocity was not
greater than 3,000 km/sec. The “coupled shutters” experiment is relatively very simple and cheap{fn-1}{fn-2}, however no
scientist in the world has repeated it. The general opinion
expressed in numerous letters to me, in referees’ comments
on my papers, and in speeches at various space-time conferences which I attended or organized{fn-3} is that my experiments are very sophisticated and difficult to execute. The _unique_ discussion _in the press_ on the _technical aspects_ of my experiments is made by Chambers{fn-4}.
Here I should  like to cite the comments of my anonymous _Foundations of Physics_ referee sent to me by the editor, Prof. van der Merwe, on the 23 June 1983:
[quote]
I was informed by (name deleted) of the Department of the Air Force, Air Force Office of Scientific Research, Bolling Air Force Base, that Dr. Marinov’s experiments were to be repeated by the Joint Institute for Laboratory Astrophysics. On inquiry, I learnt that JILA is not carrying out the experiments, because preliminary engineering studies had indicated that it lay beyond the expertise of the laboratory to achieve the mechanical tolerances needed to ensure a valid result.

After presenting my objections that the fact that JILA
in the USA is unable to repeat my experiments cannot be
considered as a ground for the rejection of my papers on the
measurement of absolute velocity, Prof. van der Merwe sent
me on the 24 January 1984 the following “second report” of
the same referee:

[quote]
It is with regret that I cannot change my recommendation regarding Dr. Marinov’s papers. In trying to justify the validity of his experimental work, Dr. Marinov
highlights the points which cause the rest of the community so much concern. He states, “If I in a secondhand workshop in a fortnight for USD 500 achieve the
necessary accuracy, then, I suppose, JILA can achieve
it too.” I know of no one in the precision measurement
community who believes that measurements of the
quality claimed by Dr. Marinov could be realized
under such conditions and in so short a time. It will
take very much more than this to change the direction
of physics. I suspect that even scientists working in the
most reputable laboratories in the U.S. or the world,
would encounter great opposition in attempting to
publish results as revolutionary as those claimed by Dr. Marinov.

In this paper I present an account of the measurement of
the laboratory’s absolute velocity, executed by me in Graz
with the help of a new configuration of my “coupled shutters” experiment. Now the apparatus was built not in seven
days but in four. As the work was “black” (a mechanician in
a university workshop did it after working hours and I paid
him “in the hand”), the apparatus was built predominantly
over the weekend and cost 12,000 Shillings (USD 1000).
The driving motor was taken from an old washing-machine
and cost nothing.

As no scientific laboratory was inclined to offer me hospitality and the possibility to use a laser source and laboratory mirrors, my first intention was to use as a light source,
the Sun. As I earn my bread and money for continuing the
scientific research, working as a groom and sleeping in a
stall in a small village near Graz, I carried out the experiment
in the apartment of my girl-friend. The sensitivity which I
obtained with Sun’s light (a perfect source of homogeneous
parallel light) was good, but there were two inconveniences:

1. The motion of the Sun is considerable during the time
when one makes the reversal of the axle and one cannot be
sure whether the observed effect is due to the delay times of
the light pulses or to the Sun’s motion;
2. One can perform measurements only for a couple of hours about noon and
thus there is no possibility to obtain a 24-hour “sinusoid”
(explanation of the measuring procedure follows).

On the other hand, at fast rotation of the axle the holed rotating
disks became two sirens, so that when my apparatus began to
whistle the neighbors knocked on the door, asking in dismay:
“Fliegt schon der Russe uber Wien?” (Is Ivan already flying
over Vienna?). After a couple of altercations, my girl-friend
threw out of her apartment not only my apparatus but also me.

Later, however, I found a possibility to execute the experiment in a laboratory <<fig-1,(Fig. 1)>>. The scheme of the experiment, its theoretical background and measuring procedure,
are exactly the same as for the Brussels variation{fn-1}{fn-2}.
Since the description is extremely simple and short, I shall
also give it here, noting that the mounting of the laser and
of the mirrors on the laboratory table lasted two hours.

But first, following the example of _Nature_ which gives
interesting quotations from its editions many years ago, I
should like to also give one similarly:

[quote]
If it were possible to measure with sufficient accuracy
the velocity of light without returning the ray to its
starting point, the problem of measuring the first
power of the relative velocity of the Earth with respect
to the aether would be solved. This may not be as
hopeless as might appear at first sight, since the difficulties are entirely mechanical and may possibly be surmounted in the course of time.

The names of the authors are Michelson and Morley,
the year of publication is 1887. This is the paper in which
Michelson and Morley give their account of the historical
experiment for “measurement” of the two-way light velocity.
The paper was published in two journals: _The Philosophical Magazine_ and _American Journal of Science_. After giving
this general opinion, Michelson and Morley proposed an
experiment which is almost the _same_ as my deviant “coupled
mirrors” experiment{fn-5}{fn-6}{fn-2}. They proposed to use a bridge
method with two selenium cells where the null instrument is
a telephone. I must emphasize that I could not succeed in
finding a _single_ paper or book treating the historic MichelsonMorley experiment, where information on their one-way proposal should be given. Let me note that in the MichelsonMorley experiment one compares the two-way light velocity in two mutually perpendicular directions, but one cannot measure its value.

[#fig-1]
.The Graz “coupled shutters” experiment during preliminary measurements in the air of the laboratory; when performing measurements in vacuum the laser was mounted in parallel with the axle and the regulator for motor’s velocity (to be seen between the motor and the far disk) was taken outside the evacuated space. At the left corner of the apparatus’ plate one sees the socket for one of the reflecting mirrors for the case that Sun’s light should be used (the socket of the other reflecting mirror is at the far right corner). The mechanician spent considerable time (and I lost money) for mastering the *adjustable* reflecting mirrors for Sun’s light which have not been used in the laser arrangement, so that the price of the actually used apparatus had to be less than the half.

== 2. Theory of the “coupled shutters” experiment

A rotating axle driven by an electromotor, located exactly at
the middle of the axle, has two holed discs at its extremities.
The distance from the centres of the holes to the centre of
the axle is stem:[R] and the distance between the discs is stem:[d]. Light
from a laser is divided by a semi-transparent prism and the
two beams are directed by a couple of adjustable mirrors, to
the opposite ends of the rotating axle, so that the beams can
pass through the discs’ holes in mutually opposite directions.
Any of the beams, after being chopped by the near disc
and “detected” by the far disc, illuminates a photocell. By
means of a galvanometer one measures the difference in the
currents generated by both photocells. If covering one of the
cells, one measures the current produced by the other cell.

One arranges the position of the laser beam with respect
to the discs’ holes in such a manner that when the axle is
at rest the light of the laser which passes through the near
hole illuminates _half_ of the far hole. One then sets the axle
in rotation, gradually increasing its speed. Since the light
pulses cut by the near holes have a transit time in order to
reach the far holes, with the increase of the rate of rotation
less and less light will pass through the far holes, when the
distant holes “escape” from the light beam positions, and,
conversely, more and more light will pass through the far
holes, when the distant holes “enter” into the light beam
positions. For brevity I shall call the first kind of far holes
“escaping” and the second kind of far holes “entering”.

If one assumes that the holes as well as the beams’ crosssections are rectangular and the illuminations homogeneous, then the current stem:[I_(hom)] produced by either of the photocells
will be proportional to the breadth stem:[b] of the light spot measured on the surface of the photocell when the axle is rotating, i.e., stem:[I_(hom) ∼ b]. When the rotational rate of the axle increases by stem:[ΔN], the breadth of the light beam passing through the
“escaping” holes will become stem:[b − Δb], while the breadth of
the light beam passing through “entering” holes will become
stem:[b + Δb], and the produced currents will become 
stem:[I_(hom) − ΔI ∼ b − Δb], stem:[I_(hom) + ΔI ∼ b + Δb]. Thus
[stem#f1]
.(1)
++++
Δb = b (ΔI)/I_(hom),
++++
where stem:[ΔI] is the _half_ of the _change_ in the _difference of the currents_ produced by the photocells.

One rotates the axle first with stem:[ΔN / 2] counter-clockwise and
then with stem:[ΔN / 2] clockwise, that corresponds to a change stem:[ΔN]
in the rate of rotation. Since
[stem#f2]
.(2)
++++
Δb = (d//c) π ΔNR,
++++
for the one-way velocity of light one obtains
[stem#f3]
.(3)
++++
c = (2π ΔNRd) / b I_(hom)/(ΔI)
++++

In my experiment the holes, as well as the light beams,
were circular, not rectangular. Consequently, instead of the
measured light spot’s breadth, one has to take a certain
_slightly different_ “effective” breadth. As the breadth stem:[b] can
never be measured accurately, the discussion of the difference
between real breadth and “effective” breadth is senseless.
Much more important, however, was the fact that the illumination in the beams’ cross-sections was not homogeneous: at the centre it was maximum and at the periphery minimum.

Thus the simplified relation <<f1>> did not correspond to reality
if under stem:[I_(hom)] one would understand the measured current. I
shall give here a certain amelioration of formula <<f1>>, which
was omitted in {fn-1}, because of a fear that the presumed
referee would consider my analysis as an “artificial speculation”
in a search “to adapt the observed values to the
theoretical formula”. Now I am no more afraid of the referee.
The illumination will be assumed to increase _linearly_ from
zero on the periphery of the light beam to a maximum at its
center where the beam is “cut” by the holes’ rims. The _real_
current stem:[I] which one measures is proportional to a certain
_middle_ illumination across the whole light beam, while the
_real_ current stem:[ΔI] is proportional to the _maximum_ illumination
at the centre of the light beam. On the other hand, one must
take into account that when the holes let the light beam fall
on the photocell, first light comes from the peripheral parts
and at the end from the central parts. When half of the beam
has illuminated the photocell, the “left” part of the beam
begins to disappear and its “right” part begins to appear,
the breadth remaining always _half_ of the beam. Then the
holes’ rims begin to extinguish first the central parts of the
beam and at the end the peripheral parts. Here, for simplicity,
I suppose that the cross-sections of the beams and of the
holes are the same (in reality the former were smaller than
the latter). Thus during the first one-third of the time of
illumination the “left” half of the light beam appears, during
the second one-third of the time of illumination the “left”
half goes over to the “right” half, and during the last
one-third of the time of illumination the “right” half disappears.
Consequently, the _real_ current, stem:[I], produced by the photocell
will be related to the _idealized_ current, stem:[I_(hom)], corresponding
to a _homogeneous illumination with the central intensity_ and
_generated by a light spot having the half-breadth of the
measured one_, by the following connection

[stem#f4]
.(4)
++++
I = 1/2 int_0^1 I_(hom) x ( 2/3 − x/3 ) dx =

= I_(hom)/6 (x^2 − x^3 / 3) |_0^1
= I_(hom) / 9 .
++++

In this formula stem:[I_(hom)dx] is the current produced by a
strip with breadth stem:[dx] of the light beam; at the periphery
of the beam (where stem:[x = 0]) the produced current is zero
and at the centre (where stem:[x = 1]) it is stem:[I_(hom)dx]. The current
stem:[I_(hom)dx] is produced (i.e. the corresponding photons strike
the photocell) during time stem:[2/3 − x/3 ;] for the periphery of the
beam this time is stem:[2/3 − 0/3 = 2/3] and for the centre of the beam
this time is stem:[2/3 − 1/3 = 1/3] . The factor stem:[1/2] before the integral is
present because the _measured_ breadth of the light spot over
the photocell is _twice_ its _working_ breadth. Putting <<f4>> into
<<f3>>, one obtains
[stem#f5]
.(5)
++++
c = (2πΔNRd)/b (9I) / (ΔI).
++++

According to my absolute space-time theory{fn-2}{fn-6}{fn-7}
(and according to anybody who is acquainted _even superficially_
with the experimental evidence accumulated by humanity),
if the _absolute velocity’s component_ of the laboratory
along the direction of light propagation is stem:[v], then the velocity
of light is stem:[c − v] along the propagation direction and stem:[c + v]
against. For these two cases formula <<f5>> is to be replaced by
the following two

[stem#f6]
.(6)
++++
c - v = (2πΔNRd)/b (9I) / (ΔI + δI),

c + v = (2πΔNRd)/b (9I) / (ΔI - δI),
++++
where stem:[ΔI + δI] and stem:[ΔI − δI] are the changes of the currents
generated by the photocells when the rate of rotation changes
by stem:[ΔN]. Dividing the second formula <<f6>> by the first one, one
obtains

[stem#f7]
.(7)
++++
v = ((δI) / (ΔI)) c.
++++

Thus the measuring method consists of the following:
One changes the rotational rate by stem:[ΔN] and measures the
change in the current of either of the photocells, which is
stem:[ΔI ≃ ΔI ± δI]; then one measures the difference of these
two changes which is stem:[2δI]. I made both these measurements
by a differential method with the same galvanometer, applying to it the difference of the outputs of both photocells.
To measure stem:[2ΔI] I made the far holes for one of the beam
“escaping” and for the other “entering”. To measure stem:[2δI]
I made all far holes “escaping” (or all “entering”).

== 3. Measurement of stem:[c]
In the Graz variation of my “coupled-shutters” experiment I
had: stem:[d = 120] cm, stem:[R = 12] cm. The light source was an Ar
laser, the photocells were silicon photocollectors, and the
measuring instrument was an Austrian “Norma” galvanometer. I measured stem:[I = 21] mA (i.e., stem:[I_(hom) = 189] mA) at a rotational rate of 200 rev/sec. Changing the rotation from clockwise to counter-clockwise, i.e., with stem:[ΔN = 400] rev/sec, I
measured stem:[ΔI = 52.5] μA (i.e., the measured change in the
difference current at “escaping” and “entering” far holes was
stem:[2ΔI = 105] μA). I evaluated a breadth of the light spot
stem:[b = 4.3±0.9] mm and thus I obtained stem:[c = (3.0±0.6)×10^8] m/sec,
where error is taken as only the error in the estimation of stem:[b],
because the “weights” of the errors introduced by the measurement
of stem:[d, R, ΔN, I, ΔI] were much smaller. I repeat,
the breadth stem:[b] cannot be measured exactly as the peripheries
of the light spot are not sharp. As a matter of fact, I chose
such a breadth in the possible uncertainty range of stem:[±1] mm,
so that the exact value of stem:[c] to be obtained. I wish once more
to emphasize that the theory for the measurement of stem:[c] is
built on the assumption of rectangular holes and light beams
cross-sections and linear increase of the illumination from
the periphery to the center. These simplified assumptions
do not correspond to the more complicated real situation.
Let me state clearly: The “coupled shutters” experiment is
not to be used for an _exact_ measurement of stem:[c]. It is, however,
to be used for sufficiently accurate measurement of the
variations of stem:[c] due to the absolute velocity of the laboratory
when, during the different hours of the day, the axis of the
apparatus takes different orientations in absolute space due
to the daily rotation of the Earth (or if one would be able to
place the set-up on a rotating platform). The reader will see
this now.

== 4. Measurement of stem:[v]
The measurement of stem:[c] is an _absolute_, while the measurement
of stem:[v] is a _relative_, taking the velocity of light stem:[c] as known.
According to formula <<f7>> one has to measure only two difference currents:
stem:[2ΔI] (at “escaping” and “entering” far holes)
and stem:[2δI] (at “escaping” or “entering” far holes).
The measurement in the air of the laboratory had two important inconveniences:

1. Dust in the air led to very big fluctuations in the measured current differences
and I had to use a big condenser in parallel with the galvanometer’s entrance,
making the apparatus very sluggish;
2. The shrill of the holed disks at high rotational rate could lead to the same gloomy result as
when executing the experiment in the apartment of my girlfriend.

Thus I covered the whole set-up with a metal cover
and evacuated the air by using an oil pump (this amelioration
cost an additional 9,000 Shilling, i.e. USD 700). The performance of the experiment in vacuum has also the advantage that those people who wish to save at any price the false
dogma of the constancy of the velocity of light, cannot raise
the objection that the observed effect is due to temperature
disturbances.

The measurement of stem:[ΔI] is a simple problem as the effect
is _huge_. Moreover all existing physical schools cannot raise
objections against the theory presented above. However, the
measurement of stem:[δI] which is with three orders lower than
stem:[ΔI] has certain peculiarities which must be well understood.
When changing the rotation from clockwise to counterclockwise, the current produced by the one photocell changes,
say, from stem:[I_1] to stem:[I_1 + ΔI_1 + δI_1] and of the other photocell
from, say, stem:[I_2] to stem:[I_2 + ΔI_2 − δI_2]. One makes stem:[I_1] to be equal
to stem:[I_2], changing the light beam positions by manipulating the
reflecting mirrors micrometrically. One can with difficulty
obtain an exact compensation, so that the galvanometer shows
a certain residual current stem:[I']. The current change stem:[ΔI_1] will be
equal to the current change stem:[ΔI_2] only if the experiment is
_entirely symmetric_. But it is difficult to achieve a complete
symmetry (and, of course, I could not achieve it in my
experiment). There are the following disturbances: On the
one hand, the distribution of the light intensities in the
crosssections of both beams and the forms of the beams are not
exactly the same; thus the covering of the same geometrical
parts of both beams when changing the rotation of the axle
does not lead to equal changes in the light intensities of
both beams and, consequently, to stem:[ΔI_1 = ΔI_2]. On the other
hand, although the photocells were taken from a unique
Sun collector cut in two pieces, even if the changes in the
illuminations should be equal, the produced currents may
become different (the current gain at the different points
of the photocells is not the same, the internal resistances
of the cells are not equal, etc. etc.). Thus after changing
the rotational rate from clockwise to counter-clockwise, I
measured certain current stem:[I''], but stem:[I'' − I'] was not equal to
stem:[2δI], as it _must be_ for an entirely symmetric setup. However,
measuring the difference stem:[I'' − I'] during different hours of
the day, I established that it was “sinusoidally modulated”.
This “sinusoidal modulation” was due to the absolute velocity stem:[v].
All critics of my “rotating axle” experiments vociferate
mostly against the vibrations of the axle, asserting that these
vibrations will mar the whole measurement. Meanwhile the
axle caused me _absolutely no troubles_. When measuring in
vacuum the axis of the apparatus pointed north/south.

I measured the “sinusoidal modulation” over 5 days,
from the 9th to the 13th February 1984. As I did the experiment alone,
I could not cover all 24 hours of every day.
The results of the measurements are presented in <<fig-2,Fig. 2>>. The
most sensible scale unit of the galvanometer was 10 nA and
the fluctuations were never bigger than 20 nA. The daytime
hours are on the abscissa and the current differences on the
left ordinate. After plotting the registered values of stem:[I'' − I']
and drawing the best fit curve, the “null line” (i.e., the
abscissa) is drawn at such a “height” that the curve has
to cut _equal_ parts of the abscissa (of any 12 hours). Then
on the right ordinate the current stem:[2δI] is taken positive
upwards from the null line and negative downwards. Since
105 μA corresponds to a velocity 300,000 km/sec, 10 μA
will correspond approximately to 30 km/sec. Considering
the fluctuations of the galvanometer as a unique source of
errors, I took ±30 km/sec as the uncertainty error in the
measurement of stem:[v].

[#fig-2]
.Measurement of stem:[2δI]. The points give the measurements at the even hours for the days from the 9th to the 13th February 1984.
image::img/2.png[]

When stem:[2δI] has maximum or minimum the Earth’s absolute
velocity lies in the plane of the laboratory’s meridian
<<fig-3,(Fig. 3)>>. The velocity components pointing to the north are
taken positive and those pointing to the south negative. I
always denote by stem:[v_a] the component whose algebraic value
is smaller. When both light beams pass through “escaping”
holes, then, in the case that the absolute velocity component
points to the north, the “north” photocell produces less
current than the “south” photocell (with respect to the case
when the absolute velocity component is perpendicular to
the axis of the apparatus), while in the case that the absolute
velocity component points to the south, the “north” photocell
produces more current. If the light beams pass through “entering”
holes, all is vice versa. Let me note that for the case
shown in <<fig-3,Fig. 3>> (which does not correspond to the real situation,
as in reality stem:[v_a] is negative) both velocity components
point to the north and both stem:[v_a] and stem:[v_b] are positive. In this
case the “variation curve” no longer has the character of a
“sinusoid”; it has 4 extrema (for 24 hours) and the “null line”
must be drawn tangentially to the lowest minimum.

[#fig-3,align="center"]
.The Earth and its absolute velocity at the two moments when the laboratory meridian lies in the velocity’s plane
image::img/3.png[]

As can be seen from <<fig-3,Fig. 3>>, the two components of
the Earth’s absolute velocity in the horizontal plane of the
laboratory, stem:[v_a] and stem:[v_b], are connected with the magnitude stem:[v]
of the absolute velocity by the following relations
[stem#f8]
.(8)
++++
v_a = v sin (δ − φ),

v_b = v sin (δ + φ),
++++

where stem:[φ] is the latitude of the laboratory and stem:[δ] is the declination of the velocity’s apex. From these one obtains

[stem#f9]
.(9)
++++
v = ({v_a^2 + v_b^2 − 2v_av_b (cos^2φ − sin^2φ)}^(1/2)) / (2 sin φ cos φ),

tan δ = (v_b + v_a) / (v_b − v_a) tan φ .
++++

Obviously the apex of stem:[v] points to the meridian of stem:[v_a].
Thus the right ascension stem:[α] of the apex equaled the local
sidereal time of registration of stem:[v_a]. From <<fig-2,Fig. 2>> it is to be
seen that this moment can be determined with an accuracy
of stem:[±1^h]. Thus it was enough to calculate (with an inaccuracy
not larger than stem:[±5] min) the sidereal time stem:[t_(si)] for the meridian
where the local time is the same as the standard time stem:[t_(st)] of
registration, taking into account that the sidereal time at a
middle midnight is as follows:

The graph in <<fig-2,Figure 2>> shows that on the 11th February
(the middle day of observation) I registered in Graz
stem:[(φ = 47^@, δ = 15^@ 260')] the following components of the absolute
velocity at the following hours (for stem:[2 (δI)_a = −120]nA, and
stem:[2 (δI)_b =50]nA)

v_a = −342 ± 30 "km/sec", (t_(st))_a = 3^h ± 1^h,

where the errors are calculated supposing stem:[φ = 45^@].

The local sidereal time for the observation of stem:[v_a] (i.e., the
right ascension of the absolute velocity’s apex)
was calculated in the following manner: As for any day the sidereal
time increases by stem:[4^m] (with respect to the solar time),
the sidereal time at midnight on the 11th February (which follows
21 days after midnight on the 21 January) was stem:[8^h+1^h 24^m = 9^h 24^m].
At stem:[3^h] middle European (i.e., Graz) time on the
11th February the local sidereal time on the 15th meridian
was stem:[9^h 24^m + 3^h = 12^h 24^m]. On the Graz meridian the local
sidereal time was stem:[12^h 24^m + 2^m = 12^h 26^m ≃ 12.5^h].

*Important remark.* I now establish that when calculating
the local sidereal time of observation of stem:[v_a] for my interferometric
“coupled mirrors” experiment{fn-2}{fn-6}{fn-8}{fn-9}, I made a
very _unpleasant error_. As Sofia stem:[(λ = 23^@ 210')] lies westwards
from the middle zonal meridian stem:[(λ = 30^@)], I had to _subtract_
the difference of stem:[6^@ 390'], which corresponds to stem:[27^m], from the
local sidereal time of the zonal meridian. Instead of doing
this, I _wrongly_ added. Thus the numbers given by me are to
be corrected as follows:

I beg the persons who will refer to the measurement of
the Sun’s absolute velocity determined by me in 1975/76
to cite _always_ the corrected figures given here and not the
wrongly calculated figures presented in {fn-2}{fn-6}{fn-8}{fn-9}{fn-10}{fn-11}
and in some others of my papers.

== 5. Conclusions

Comparing the figures obtained now by the Graz variation of
my “coupled shutters” experiment with the figures obtained
some ten years ago in Sofia by the interferometric “coupled
mirrors” experiment, one sees that within the limits of the
supposed errors they overlap. Indeed, on the 11 January 1976
I registered in Sofia the following figures

[stem#f12]
.(12)
++++
v = 327 ± 20 "km/sec",

δ = −21^@ ± 4^@," " α = 13^h 17^m ± 20^m.
++++

As for the time of one month the figures do not change
significantly, one can compare directly the figures <<f11>> with
the figures <<f12>>. The declinations are the same. As the Graz
measurements were done every two hours, the registration of
the right ascension was not exact enough and the difference
of about one hour is not substantial. I wish to point only to
the difference between the magnitudes which is 35 km/sec. I
have the intuitive feeling that the figures obtained in Sofia
are more near to reality. The reason is that _I profoundly
believe in the mystique of the numbers_, and my Sofia measurements
led to the magic number 300 km/sec for the Sun’s
absolute velocity (which number is to be considered together
with 300,000 km/sec for light velocity and 30 km/sec for the
Earth’s orbital velocity). The Graz measurement destroys
this mystic harmony.

The presented account on the Graz “coupled shutters”
experiment shows that the experiment is _childishly simple_, as
I always asserted{fn-1}{fn-2}. If the scientific community refuses
to accept my measurements for so many years and nobody
tries to repeat them, the answer can be found in the following
words of one of my _best physical and moral teachers_:

[quote,Albert Einstein]
*Terrible is the power which an authority exerts over the world.*

I wish to add in closing that with a letter of the 29 December 1983 I informed the Nobel committee that I am ready
at any time to bring (for my account) the “coupled shutters”
experiment to Stockholm and to demonstrate the registration
of the Earth’s absolute motion. With a letter of 28 January
1984 Dr. B. Nagel of the Physics Nobel committee informed
me that my letter had been received.

.February 1984. Explaining the essence of the “coupled shutters” experiment. My fingers show the ways in which both light beams go from the one perforated disk to the other. One can see on the photograph only a small part of the laser producing the initial light beam which is split by the semitransparent mirror seen in the photograph. The reflected beam goes to the left, while the refracted beam, after a reflection on the mirror seen in the photograph, goes to the right. Between the perforated disks, these two beams proceed in the opposite directions. The person who gave me a possibility to carry out my “coupled shutters” experiment in his laboratory took from me the solemn promise that I shall never say where have I carried it out. To my question, why is he so afraid, the answer was: “I do not wish one day to be poisoned by certain special services.”
